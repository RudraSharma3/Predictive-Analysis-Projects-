# Predictive Analysis Projects

## Overview
This repository showcases collaborative group projects in Predictive Analysis undertaken at UPES. These projects leverage advanced machine learning and deep learning models to address diverse real-world challenges in fields such as mental health, women safety, and crop disease detection.

## Key Features
- **Mental Health Prediction:** Development of models to assess and predict mental health conditions using behavioral and psychological data.
- **Women Safety:** Predictive systems utilizing real-time data and geospatial analysis to enhance safety measures.
- **Crop Disease Detection:** Robust deep learning solutions to identify and predict crop diseases from agricultural datasets.
- **Insightful Dashboards:** Comprehensive visualization tools for clear and actionable insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Models:**
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Visualization Tools:**
  - Data-driven dashboards
  - Statistical graphs and heatmaps
- **Programming Languages:** Python (TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Pandas, etc.)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/predictive-analysis-projects.git
   ```
2. Ensure Python 3.8+ and required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Navigate to the project folder of your choice and run the scripts.

## Usage
1. **Mental Health Prediction:**
   Navigate to the `mental-health-prediction` folder and run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Women Safety:**
   Explore safety models and visualizations in the `women-safety` folder:
   ```bash
   python women_safety_analysis.py
   ```
3. **Crop Disease Detection:**
   Use the `crop-disease-detection` folder to execute models and visualize predictions:
   ```bash
   python crop_disease_detection.py
   ```
